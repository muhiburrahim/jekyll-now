End of the 12th semester at North South University. Finished less than ideal credits. But I learnt a few things in the database course. The instructors could have done a better job at handing out instructions that actually help, but I digress and I wont complain. I learnt that web development is actual hard work that takes dedication I was wrong to have assumed that this isn't so. Walk of shame. I know very little, and its going to be hard work to acclimatize. 

Note to self: Never assume you know more than other people, especially on topics you actually don't know anything about. 

Anyway those are lessons learnt this semester. 

Moving on, this semester I have set up some concrete goals. Learn Python well. Learn Django. Learn graphics design. Learn to play the guitar well.
